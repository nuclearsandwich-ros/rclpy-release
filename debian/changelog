  * Updated code to match API change needed to avoid accidental nullptr dereference. (#157 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/157>)
    * Signed-off-by: Ethan Gao <mailto:ethan.gao@linux.intel.com>
  * Added a sleep to workaround race condition in MultiThreadedExecutor test. (#168 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/168>)
  * Disable 1kHz timer tests on the ARM architectures. (#169 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/169>)
    * Publish parameter events.
    Adds a parameter event publisher to rclpy nodes.
    * Increase base number of publishers for testing.
    Because every node has a parameter events publisher bump the number of
    expected publishers in a couple of cases.
    * Remove comment now that parameter services are implemented.
    * Delete NOT_SET parameters if present regardless of prior type.
    * Use ParameterMsg rather than RCLParameter for msg type name.
